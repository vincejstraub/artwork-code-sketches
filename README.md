## General info
This repository contains the code used to create _Walking nowhere in particular_ (2020) [insert link] and _A la Recherche de Vera Moln치r_ (2020) [insert link], two algorithmic artworks. The text below summarizes each file and it's function, with further comments provided throughout the code. To create your own images simply load the example notebooks, executing cells one by one, or run the scripts in your terminal.

## Code 

* All random walk visualizations for _Walking nowhere in particular (2020)_ are generated using the script `SWRdrawer`, which implements a [simple random walk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk); at each step the location is programmed to jump to a neighbouring site according to a predefined probability distribution and step count. The images will be saved to a directory called `Images/`. `SRWdrawer.ipynb` provides examples of how to run the script. Afterwards, you will have a collection of still images from which a video can be created by stitching the images into a gif or mp4:

* `a_la_recherche_de_Vera_Molner` plots a simple random walk drawing in 2 dimensions, calling an image interpolation method to fill out the image. Pioneer of algorithmic computer art Vera Moln치r (aged 96 at the time of writing and still working) once said, "the machine, thought to be cold and inhuman, can help to realize what is most subjective, unattainable, and profound in a human being". Taking inspiration from this sentiment, _A la Recherche de Vera Moln치r_ is a simplistic demonstration that a few lines of code generate abstract visualizations, creating surprise, color, and suspense.

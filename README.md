## Walking nowhere in particular

In Mathematics, a random walk is a process that describes a path consisting of a succession of random steps on some mathematical space. Random walk theory has found a wide variety of applications in the natural world; the search path of a foraging animal, the trajectory of pollen particles and the motion of a cell can all can be approximated by random walk models. 

By visualizing multiple random walks in a two dimensional grid, _Walking nowhere in particular_ explores their metaphorical reach to other realms; each walk is taken to figuratively visualize complex and ephemeral aspects of reality—be it the growth of bacteria in a petri dish, an individual searching for love or the movements of a bored house cat.
